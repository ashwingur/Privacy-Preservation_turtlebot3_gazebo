# Privacy Preserving Robotic Vision 
Author: Ashwin Gur

This repository demonstrates a privacy-preserving robotic navigation method in simulation. 
- The simulation environment uses [ROS 2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html) and [Gazebo-classic](https://classic.gazebosim.org/).
- During development and experimentation, the environment ran on `Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS`.
- The initial setup was cloned from https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/turtlebot3_simulations
